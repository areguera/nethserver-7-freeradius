nethserver-freeradius
=====================

This package provides integration for FreeRADIUS in NethServer. It
turns your server into a centralized network authentication server, so
you can easily control what devices can access the network. The
authentication server is prepared to control network access using MAC
address, IEEE802.1X or both.

The authentication server provided by this package is only one
component of the three elements a RADIUS infrastructure is made of.
The other two elements (the authenticator and the supplicant) are not
configured by this package.  That is something you must do first,
before you can enjoy a successful RADIUS infrastructure.

Installation
------------

To install `nethserver-freeradius` package, run the following command
(as the root user):

    yum --enablerepo=nethforge-testing install nethserver-freeradius

After installation look for "FreeRADIUS" panel in the "Configuration"
section of NethServer web interface. It should provide three tabs
named "Authentication Server", "Authenticators", and "Supplicants".

Configuration
-------------

In normal operation, the system administrator does the following:

1. Use the authentication server tab in FreeRADIUS panel to configure
   how authenticators will allow supplicants to access the network.
   Possible options include MAC address, IEEE802.1X or a combination
   of them both. See `/etc/raddb/sites-available/default` file.

2. Use the authenticator tab in FreeRADIUS panel to define what
   authenticator devices (e.g., access points, smart switches) can
   send access requests to the authentication server. See
   `/etc/raddb/clients.conf` file.

3. Use the supplicants tab in FreeRADIUS panel to define the MAC
   address and credentials (i.e., username and password) final users
   must set in their devices (e.g., wireless stations) to access the
   network. See `/etc/raddb/authorized_macs` and `/etc/raddb/users`
   files.

In addition to these basic steps, the system administrator might also
do the following:

1. Configure authenticator devices (e.g., access points, smart
   switches) as authenticator of the authentication server (i.e., to
   accept authentication requests from supplicants and request access
   to the centralized authentication server based on them).

2. Configure supplicant devices (e.g., wireless stations) to send
   authentication requests to authenticator devices.

3. Communicate final users (e.g., using a sealed letter) the
   credentials they must use in order to access the network.

Use Case
--------

This package might be useful for system administrators needing to
control the network access of its users as well as provide mobility to
them.  For example, consider local wireless communities made of
NanoStation devices in which one line of these devices is configured
as access points and the rest of them as client stations. The access
points, here, are configured as authenticators of a central
authentication server (running nethserver-freeradius).  The client
stations (supplicants) are configured to send access requests to the
authenticators using IEEE802.1X.

In this infrastructure:

1. The supplicant sends an Access-Request to the authenticator it
   connects to, using IEEE802.1X (e.g., EAP-MD5 or EAP-TTLS). The
   Access-Request includes the supplicant's MAC address as well as
   the "User-Name" and "User-Password" attributes.

2. The authenticator sends the Access-Request to the centralized
   authentication server.
   
3. The authentication server decides whether or not to accept the
   supplicant Access-Request and responds to the authenticator
   accordingly.
   
4. The authenticator enforces the authentication server decision to
   supplicant.
